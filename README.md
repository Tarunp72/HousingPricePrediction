# HousingPricePrediction

🧠 Project Overview
This project implements a Linear Regression model to predict housing prices based on features like furnishing status, location, and more. It's ideal for understanding how continuous numerical prediction works in ML.

📁 Dataset
File: Housing_price.csv

Contains features such as Area, Bedrooms, Bathrooms, Furnishing Status, etc.

⚙️ Technologies Used
Python

Pandas, NumPy

Scikit-learn

Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)

✅ Model Workflow
Load and clean the dataset

Encode categorical variables using Ordinal Encoding

Train/Test split

Train a Linear Regression model

Evaluate using:

MAE (Mean Absolute Error)

MSE (Mean Squared Error)

RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)

R² Score

📊 Evaluation Metrics
Used to measure model accuracy and performance on the test data.
